	abstract = {There has been an evolutionary leap in single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) imaging with the advent of camera systems which utilize solid-state crystals and novel collimator designs configured specifically for cardiac imaging. Solid-state {SPECT} camera systems have facilitated dramatic reductions in both imaging time and radiation dose, while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. These advances are related to simultaneous improvement in photon sensitivity due to the collimator and imaging geometry, as well as image resolution due to the improved energy resolution of the new crystals. Improved photon sensitivity has facilitated fast or low-dose myocardial perfusion imaging and early dynamic imaging has emerged as a technique for assessing myocardial blood flow with {SPECT}. Lastly, general-purpose solid-state camera systems and hybrid {SPECT}/{CT} systems have also been developed which may have important clinical roles in cardiac imaging. This review summarizes state-of-the-art solid-state {SPECT} myocardial perfusion imaging ({MPI}) technology and clinical applications, including emerging techniques for {SPECT} {MPI} flow estimation. We also discuss imaging protocols used with the new cameras, potential imaging pitfalls and review the latest data providing large-scale validation of the diagnostic and prognostic value of this new technology.},

	abstract = {Functional nuclear medicine imaging with single-photon emission {CT} ({SPECT}) in combination with anatomical {CT} has been commercially available since the beginning of this century. The combination of the two modalities has improved both the sensitivity and specificity of many clinical applications and {CT} in conjunction with {SPECT} that allows for spatial overlay of the {SPECT} data on good anatomy images. Introduction of diagnostic {CT} units as part of the {SPECT}/{CT} system has also potentially allowed for a more cost-efficient use of the equipment. Most of the {SPECT} systems available are based on the well-known Anger camera principle with {NaI}(Tl) as a scintillation material, parallel-hole collimators and multiple photomultiplier tubes, which, from the centroid of the scintillation light, determine the position of an event. Recently, solid-state detectors using cadmium–zinc–telluride became available and clinical {SPECT} cameras employing multiple pinhole collimators have been developed and introduced in the market. However, even if new systems become available with better hardware, the {SPECT} reconstruction will still be affected by photon attenuation and scatter and collimator response. Compensation for these effects is needed even for qualitative studies to avoid artefacts leading to false positives. This review highlights the recent progress for both new {SPECT} cameras systems as well as for various data-processing and compensation methods.},

	abstract = {A rotating-and-warping projector/backprojector is proposed for iterative algorithms used to reconstruct fan-beam and cone-beam single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) data. The development of a new projector/backprojector for implementing attenuation, geometric point response, and scatter models is motivated by the need to reduce the computation time yet to preserve the fidelity of the corrected reconstruction. At each projection angle, the projector/backprojector first rotates the image volume so that the pixelized cube remains parallel to the detector, and then warps the image volume so that the fan-beam and cone-beam rays are converted into parallel rays. In the authors' implementation, these two steps are combined so that the interpolation of voxel values are performed only once. The projection operation is achieved by a simple weighted summation, and the backprojection operation is achieved by copying weighted projection array values to the image volume. An advantage of this projector/backprojector is that the system point response function can be deconvolved via the Fast Fourier Transform using the shift-invariant property of the point response when the voxel-to-detector distance is constant. The fan-beam and cone-beam rotating-and-warping projector/backprojector is applied to {SPECT} data showing improved resolution.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The geometric point response functions are shown to be shift-invariant for these three collimators if the distance between the point source and the detection plane is constant. For single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}), this property is used in the projector/backprojector to correct for geometric distortion using the iterative {EM} reconstruction algorithm. In the implementation, the system geometric response, the crystal intrinsic response and the attenuation were compensated. The attenuation compensation was accomplished in the spatial domain. The point response corrections were accomplished using frequency domain filtering, taking advantage of the shift-invariance of the system point response function at a fixed depth. The frequency domain implementation significantly speeded up the algorithm. Phantom studies showed the increase of resolution and the reduction of density nonuniformity artifacts which were due to the spatially varying system response function and the attenuation effect.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: In the present work, the authors compare geometrical and Monte Carlo projectors in detail. The geometrical projectors considered were the conventional geometrical Siddon ray-tracer (S-{RT}) and the orthogonal distance-based ray-tracer ({OD}-{RT}), based on computing the orthogonal distance from the center of image voxel to the line-of-response. A comparison of these geometrical projectors was performed using different point spread function ({PSF}) models. The Monte Carlo-based method under consideration involves an extensive model of the system response matrix based on Monte Carlo simulations and is computed off-line and stored on disk.
{METHODS}: Comparisons were performed using simulated and experimental data of the commercial small animal {PET} scanner {rPET}.
{RESULTS}: The results demonstrate that the orthogonal distance-based ray-tracer and Siddon ray-tracer using {PSF} image-space convolutions yield better images in terms of contrast and spatial resolution than those obtained after using the conventional method and the multiray-based S-{RT}. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo-based method yields slight improvements in terms of contrast and spatial resolution with respect to these geometrical projectors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The orthogonal distance-based ray-tracer and Siddon ray-tracer using {PSF} image-space convolutions represent satisfactory alternatives to factorizing the system matrix or to the conventional on-the-fly ray-tracing methods for list-mode reconstruction, where an extensive modeling based on Monte Carlo simulations is unfeasible.},

The {OMEGA} toolkit was originally designed for the easy image reconstruction of positron emission tomography ({PET}) data. Now we extend many of the features available for {PET} imaging to also for transmission tomography, with examples provided for cone beam computed tomography ({CBCT}). {OMEGA} supports both {MAT}-{LAB} and the open-source alternative {GNU} Octave. All built-in algorithms for {PET} are available for the transmission tomography case. These include 10 (Poisson) maximum likelihood algorithms, 8 maximum a posteriori algorithms and 11 priors. Furthermore, custom algorithms using Gaussian-based reconstruction can be implemented with a {MATLAB}/Octave class object that can be used to compute either the forward projection or backward projection. {OMEGA} reconstructions, whether using the built-in functions or the class object, can be performed by using parallel computing utilizing either {OpenCL} for {GPUs} or {OpenMP} for {CPUs}. Both methods allow for completely matrix-free computations, enabling the use of high resolution scanners with the optimized use of memory. {OpenCL} and {OpenMP} also enable the use of any computer hardware in the reconstruction. Additionally, as with {PET} data, built-in support exists for {GATE} simulated {CBCT} data allowing easy reconstructions of Monte Carlo simulated data. This extension to transmission tomography extends the usability of {OMEGA} software to the efficient reconstruction of transmission tomography data.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is the evaluation of on-the-fly volume of intersection computation for system's geometry modelling in 3D {PET} image reconstruction. For this purpose we propose a simple geometrical model in which the cubic image voxels on the given Cartesian grid are approximated with spheres and the rectangular tubes of response ({ToRs}) are approximated with cylinders. The model was integrated into a fully 3D list-mode {PET} reconstruction for performance evaluation. In our model the volume of intersection between a voxel and the {ToR} is only a function of the impact parameter (the distance between voxel centre to {ToR} axis) but is independent of the relative orientation of voxel and {ToR}. This substantially reduces the computational complexity of the system matrix calculation. Based on phantom measurements it was determined that adjusting the diameters of the spherical voxel size and the {ToR} in such a way that the actual voxel and {ToR} volumes are conserved leads to the best compromise between high spatial resolution, low noise, and suppression of Gibbs artefacts in the reconstructed images. Phantom as well as clinical datasets from two different {PET} systems (Siemens {ECAT} {HR}(+) and Philips Ingenuity-{TF} {PET}/{MR}) were processed using the developed and the respective vendor-provided (line of intersection related) reconstruction algorithms. A comparison of the reconstructed images demonstrated very good performance of the new approach. The evaluation showed the respective vendor-provided reconstruction algorithms to possess 34-41\% lower resolution compared to the developed one while exhibiting comparable noise levels. Contrary to explicit point spread function modelling our model has a simple straight-forward implementation and it should be easy to integrate into existing reconstruction software, making it competitive to other existing resolution recovery techniques.},

Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate λ of λ which maximizes the probability p(n*{\textbar}λ) of observing the actual detector count data n* over all possible densities λ. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means λ(b), b = 1, ···, B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter.

	abstract = {The implementation of emission-computed tomography ({ECT}), including positron emission tomography and single-photon emission-computed tomography, has been an important research topic in recent years and is of significant and practical importance. However, the slow rate of convergence and the computational complexity have severely impeded the efficient implementation of iterative reconstruction. By combining the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization ({MLEM}) iteratively along with the Beltrami filter, this paper proposes a new approach to reformulate the {MLEM} algorithm. Beltrami filtering is applied to an image obtained using the {MLEM} algorithm for each iteration. The role of Beltrami filtering is to remove mainly out-of-focus slice blurs, which are artifacts present in most existing images. To improve the quality of an image reconstructed using {MLEM}, the Beltrami filter employs similar structures, which in turn reduce the number of errors in the reconstructed image. Numerical image reconstruction tomography experiments have demonstrated the performance capability of the proposed algorithm in terms of an increase in signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) and the recovery of fine details that can be hidden in the data. The {SNR} and visual inspections of the reconstructed images are significantly improved compared to those of a standard {MLEM}. We conclude that the proposed algorithm provides an edge-preserving image reconstruction and substantially suppress noise and edge artifacts.},

	abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography ({CT}) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize {CT} data in heterogeneous dose calculation algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, {CT} data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing “radiographs,” which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the {CT} array. Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of {CT} data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the {CT} data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the {CT} data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional {CT} array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in fortran-77 on a {VAX} 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, technical innovations in computed tomography ({CT}) have constantly extended its spectrum of clinical applications and made new radiodiagnostic applications accessible. At the same time, concerns have arisen with respect to the radiation exposure to the patients caused by {CT} examinations. In order to address this issue, different strategies for radiation dose reduction in {CT} have been introduced, spanning technical approaches as well as specific examination techniques applied in clinical practice, such as reduced-dose {CT}. Developed technical approaches for reducing radiation dose in {CT} by improvements of {CT} scanner hardware and acquisition mechanisms, however, have not been sufficient to address the degradation of image quality caused by increasing noise and susceptibility to artifacts inherent to reduced-dose {CT} acquisitions. Recent advances in computing power have enabled the development of software-based methods for iterative image reconstruction ({IR}) in {CT} enabling simultaneous reduction of image noise and improvement of overall image quality. Thereby, {IR} allows for dose reduction by reconstruction of low-noise image data from intrinsically noisy reduced-dose {CT} acquisitions, thereby preserving diagnostic image quality equivalent to current clinical standards. This review provides an overview of the underlying basic principles of iterative image reconstruction methods currently available for and applied in {CT} imaging, independent of vendor-specific details regarding algorithms and implementations. It discusses potential strengths and weaknesses of these {CT} image reconstruction techniques in view of their application in clinical routine, especially in view of the potential of {IR} for noise and artifact reduction as well as for radiation dose reduction. Furthermore, the effect of statistical (hybrid) and model-based {IR} methods on image quality are exemplarily illustrated in comparison to filtered back projection ({FBP}) traditionally used for image reconstruction in {CT}.},

The availability of large computational capacities in normal workstations and the ongoing efforts towards lower doses in {CT} have changed the situation; {IR} has become a hot topic for all major vendors of clinical {CT} systems in the past 5 years. This review strives to provide information on {IR} methods and aims at interested physicists and physicians already active in the field of {CT}.

As a practical example, details on a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm implemented on a modern graphics adapter ({GPU}) are presented, followed by application examples for several dedicated {CT} scanners in order to demonstrate the performance and potential of iterative reconstruction methods.

If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces. The treatment of these problems, themselves of interest, gains enhanced importance through the numerous relationships that exist between this topic and the theory of logarithmic and Newtonian potentials.

Single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) has a long history of development since its initial demonstration by Kuhl and Edwards in 1963. Although clinical utility has been dominated by the rotating gamma camera, there have been many technological innovations with the recent popularity of organ-specific dedicated {SPECT} systems. The combination of {SPECT} and {CT} evolved from early transmission techniques used for attenuation correction with the initial commercial systems predating the release of {PET}/{CT}. The development and acceptance of {SPECT}/{CT} has been relatively slow with continuing debate as to what cost/performance ratio is justified. Increasingly, fully diagnostic {CT} is combined with {SPECT} so as to facilitate optimal clinical utility.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography ({PET}) uses radioactive tracers and enables the functional imaging of several metabolic processes, blood flow measurements, regional chemical composition, and/or chemical absorption. Depending on the targeted processes within the living organism, different tracers are used for various medical conditions, such as cancer, particular brain pathologies, cardiac events, and bone lesions, where the most commonly used tracers are radiolabeled with 18F (e.g., [18F]-{FDG} and {NA} [18F]). Oxygen-15 isotope is mostly involved in blood flow measurements, whereas a wide array of 11C-based compounds have also been developed for neuronal disorders according to the affected neuroreceptors, prostate cancer, and lung carcinomas. In contrast, the single-photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) technique uses gamma-emitting radioisotopes and can be used to diagnose strokes, seizures, bone illnesses, and infections by gauging the blood flow and radio distribution within tissues and organs. The radioisotopes typically used in {SPECT} imaging are iodine-123, technetium-99m, xenon-133, thallium-201, and indium-111. This systematic review article aims to clarify and disseminate the available scientific literature focused on {PET}/{SPECT} radiotracers and to provide an overview of the conducted research within the past decade, with an additional focus on the novel radiopharmaceuticals developed for medical imaging.},

Traditional parallel-hole and fan-beam collimators used in clinical practice, for example, have a relatively poor sensitivity and subcentimeter spatial resolution, while in small-animal imaging, pinhole collimators are used to obtain submillimeter resolution and multiple pinholes are often combined to increase sensitivity. This paper reviews methods for production, sensitivity maximization, and task-based optimization of collimation for both clinical and preclinical imaging applications. New opportunities for improved collimation are now arising primarily because of (i) new collimator-production techniques and (ii) detectors with improved intrinsic spatial resolution that have recently become available. These new technologies are expected to impact the design of collimators in the future. The authors also discuss concepts like septal penetration, high-resolution applications, multiplexing, sampling completeness, and adaptive systems, and the authors conclude with an example of an optimization study for a parallel-hole, fan-beam, cone-beam, and multiple-pinhole collimator for different applications.},

	shorttitle = {Towards standardization of absolute {SPECT}/{CT} quantification},
	abstract = {Absolute quantification of radiotracer distribution using {SPECT}/{CT} imaging is of great importance for dosimetry aimed at personalized radionuclide precision treatment. However, its accuracy depends on many factors. Using phantom measurements, this multi-vendor and multi-center study evaluates the quantitative accuracy and inter-system variability of various {SPECT}/{CT} systems as well as the effect of patient size, processing software and reconstruction algorithms on recovery coefficients ({RC}).

Methods:
Five {SPECT}/{CT} systems were included: Discovery™ {NM}/{CT} 670 Pro ({GE} Healthcare), Precedence™ 6 (Philips Healthcare), Symbia Intevo™, and Symbia™ T16 (twice) (Siemens Healthineers). Three phantoms were used based on the {NEMA} {IEC} body phantom without lung insert simulating body mass indexes ({BMI}) of 25, 28, and 47 kg/m2. Six spheres (0.5-26.5 {mL}) and background were filled with 0.1 and 0.01 {MBq}/{mL} 99mTc-pertechnetate, respectively. Volumes of interest ({VOI}) of spheres were obtained by a region growing technique using a 50\% threshold of the maximum voxel value corrected for background activity. {RC}, defined as imaged activity concentration divided by actual activity concentration, were determined for maximum ({RCmax}) and mean voxel value ({RCmean}) in the {VOI} for each sphere diameter. Inter-system variability was expressed as median absolute deviation ({MAD}) of {RC}. Acquisition settings were standardized. Images were reconstructed using vendor-specific 3D iterative reconstruction algorithms with institute-specific settings used in clinical practice and processed using a standardized, in-house developed processing tool based on the {SimpleITK} framework. Additionally, all data were reconstructed with a vendor-neutral reconstruction algorithm (Hybrid Recon™; Hermes Medical Solutions).

Results:
{RC} decreased with decreasing sphere diameter for each system. Inter-system variability ({MAD}) was 16 and 17\% for {RCmean} and {RCmax}, respectively. Standardized reconstruction decreased this variability to 4 and 5\%. High {BMI} hampers quantification of small lesions ({\textless} 10 ml).

Conclusion:
Absolute {SPECT} quantification in a multi-center and multi-vendor setting is feasible, especially when reconstruction protocols are standardized, paving the way for a standard for absolute quantitative {SPECT}.},

A Monte Carlo program which simulates medical imaging nuclear detectors has been developed. Different materials can be chosen for the detector, a cover and a phantom. Cylindrical, spherical, rectangular and more complex phantom and source shapes can be simulated. Photoelectric, incoherent, coherent interactions and pair production are simulated. Different detector parameters, e.g. the energy pulse-height distribution and pulse pile-up due to finite decay time of the scintillation light emission, can be calculated. An energy resolution of the system is simulated by convolving the energy imparted with an energy-dependent Gaussian function. An image matrix of the centroid of the events in the detector can be simulated. Simulation of different collimators permits studies of spatial resolution and sensitivity. Comparisons of our results with experimental data and other published results have shown good agreement. The usefulness of the Monte Carlo code for the accurately simulation of important parameters in scintillation camera systems, stationary as well as {SPECT} (single-photon emission computed tomography) systems, has been demonstrated.},

The issue is to find the best compromise to reduce the conflicting effects induced by increasing the number of phases: lesion motion on each set of images decreases, but on the other hand image noise increases. The {IQ} {NEMA} 2001 {IEC} body phantom was used to simulate the movement of neoplastic lesions in the thorax and abdomen, investigating the effect of: target size (10 37 mm), lesion-to-background activity concentration ratio (4:1 and 8:1), total acquisition time (3, 6, 12, 20 min), and number of phase partitions (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13). The phantom was moved in a cranial-caudal direction with an excursion of 25 mm and a period of 4.0 sec. Five parameters associated to lesion volume and activity concentration were considered to assess the capability of the 4D-{PET} technique to “freeze” the phantom motion. The results for all the parameters showed the capability of the 4D-{PET} acquisition technique to “freeze” the lesion motion. The division into six phases was found to be the best compromise between temporal resolution and image noise for the phase where the “lesions” move faster; whereas the partition into four phases could be used if a stable breathing phase is considered. {PACS} number: 87.57.uk; 87.57.cp},

	shorttitle = {Monte Carlo Calculations in Nuclear Medicine},
	abstract = {The book seems to be useful as an answer to how and where to begin with applications of Monte Carlo calculations in nuclear medicine imaging. It includes basic principles of gamma cameras ({SPECT} and {PET}), but basic principles of Monte Carlo calculations are presented just for physicist; physicians interested in the field must find adequate references. From the other side, the basics of nuclear medicine instrumentation are given with plenty of physical insight. The majority of the chapters are written with a clear, uniform level; they are well linked, and the editors' work is evident. Authors demonstrate how efficient Monte Carlo simulation packages have allowed the study of scatter for more realistic activity distributions and attenuation maps, and according to a variety of physical parameters. Some of the packages commented on are: (1) {SIMSET}. For {SPECT} and {PET}. {PET} collimators simulation based on the {PETSIM} code. This program is under continuous development to include improvements in several physical effects and simulation of {SPECT} collimators and detectors. (2) {MCMATV}3D. A vectorized Monte Carlo code for phantom transport in heterogeneous media. Useful, for example, to study nonuniform attenuation compensation for simulated {SPECT} studies and to evaluate scatter subtraction methods in nonuniform media. (3) {SIMSPECT}. This validated code models tomographic imaging from nonuniform, asymmetric radionuclide source geometries. Can be used to investigate collimator geometric response including cone beam; positron emitters in {SPECT} can also be modelled with {SIMSPECT}. The code is suited to examining different collimator designs (materials and dimensions) and considering `contamination' of images by higher energy photons. (4) {SIMIND}. This program simulates clinical {SPECT} cameras including different types of detector parameters and has the capability to simulate transmission sources. Research works performed with {SIMIND} are commented on: comparison of different scatter corrections techniques, multiple windows scatter correction methods, high-count-rate detector response, transmission {SPECT}, downscatter and properties of collimators. Even if some important applications, such as the evaluation of iterative reconstruction scatter compensation, deserve more space, the authors show that Monte Carlo simulation is valuable for development, testing and comparison of scatter correction models in nuclear medicine tomographic imaging. The problem of image quality degradation when imaging a radionuclide with multiple emissions (111-In, 123-I, 67-Ga), or when acquiring simultaneous dual isotope images, is considered in relation to the design of specific collimators. A Monte Carlo simulation of photon transport that accounts for penetration of and scatter in the collimator is discussed. One of the codes presented to face this problem has been adapted for use with the {SIMIND} Monte Carlo code. Another one combines a theoretical, Bayesian observer model with the Monte Carlo numerical tool. It would be useful to know how and which of the analysed Monte Carlo methods and results are (or could be) applied in multiple head detector commercial systems. One always tries to recognize reconstructed artefacts in relation to attenuation and scatter corrections methods applied by different brands and models. The Monte Carlo tool could be an economical way to initiate technological developments of, for example, collimators or crystal design and materials or detectors geometries. Monte Carlo is presented as a useful method both for evaluating existing {PET} scanners and in designing new ones. The Monte Carlo technique is also applied to scatter correction for quantitative 3D-{PET}. Simulations of a wide variety of count rates and source distributions are essential to manufacturers, and it is shown how Monte Carlo could be a way to evaluate the performance of {PET} systems under such conditions. The presented program {PETSIM} includes independent programs for activity distribution, collimator and detector array. The results obtained are useful in designing block detectors and {PET} geometries for new systems.},

The first project focused on standardization of administered activities in pediatric nuclear medicine and resulted in 2 articles. For its second project the Nuclear Medicine Global Initiative chose to explore issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals around the world. Methods: Information was obtained by survey responses from 35 countries on available radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals, and kits for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals in individual countries were also identified. Results: Detailed information on radiopharmaceuticals used in each country, and sources of supply, was evaluated. Responses highlighted problems in access, particularly due to the reliance on a sole provider, regulatory issues, and reimbursement, as well as issues of facilities and workforce, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Strategies to address access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals are outlined, to enable timely and equitable patient access to nuclear medicine procedures worldwide. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, renewed focus on ensuring a reliable supply of radiopharmaceuticals is a major priority for nuclear medicine practice globally.},

The use of {AI} for emission computed tomography, particularly single-photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) emerged nearly 30 years ago but has been accelerated in recent years due to the development of {AI} technology. In this review, we will describe and discuss the progress of {AI} technology in {SPECT} imaging. The applications of {AI} are dispersed in disease prediction and diagnosis, post-reconstruction image denoising, attenuation map generation, and image reconstruction. These applications are relevant to many disease categories such as the neurological disorders, kidney failure, cancer, heart disease, etc. This review summarizes these applications so that {SPECT} researchers can have a reference overview of the role of {AI} in current {SPECT} studies. For each application, we followed the timeline to present the evolution of {AI}’s usage and offered insights on how {AI} was combined with the knowledge of underlying physics as well as traditional non-learning techniques. Ultimately, {AI} applications are critical to the progress of modern {SPECT} technology because they provide compensations for many deficiencies in conventional {SPECT} imaging methods and demonstrate unparalleled success. Nonetheless, {AI} also has its own challenges and limitations in the medical field, including {SPECT} imaging. These fundamental questions are discussed, and possible future directions and countermeasures are suggested.},

In particular, {GATE} allows the description of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement, and source decay kinetics. This feature makes it possible to simulate time curves under realistic acquisition conditions and to test dynamic reconstruction algorithms. This paper gives a detailed description of the design and development of {GATE} by the {OpenGATE} collaboration, whose continuing objective is to improve, document and validate {GATE} by simulating commercially available imaging systems for {PET} and {SPECT}.
