The first {CT} scanners in the early 1970s already used iterative reconstruction algorithms; however, lack of computational power prevented their clinical use. In fact, it took until 2009 for the first iterative reconstruction algorithms to come commercially available and replace conventional filtered back projection. Since then, this technique has caused a true hype in the field of radiology. Within a few years, all major {CT} vendors introduced iterative reconstruction algorithms for clinical routine, which evolved rapidly into increasingly advanced reconstruction algorithms. The complexity of algorithms ranges from hybrid-, model-based to fully iterative algorithms. As a result, the number of scientific publications on this topic has skyrocketed over the last decade. But what exactly has this technology brought us so far? And what can we expect from future hardware as well as software developments, such as photon-counting {CT} and artificial intelligence? This paper will try answer those questions by taking a concise look at the overall evolution of {CT} image reconstruction and its clinical implementations. Subsequently, we will give a prospect towards future developments in this domain.

Key Points

• Advanced {CT} reconstruction methods are indispensable in the current clinical setting.
, 
• {IR} is essential for photon-counting {CT}, phase-contrast {CT}, and dark-field {CT}.
, • Artificial intelligence will potentially further increase the performance of reconstruction methods.},

Single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) has a long history of development since its initial demonstration by Kuhl and Edwards in 1963. Although clinical utility has been dominated by the rotating gamma camera, there have been many technological innovations with the recent popularity of organ-specific dedicated {SPECT} systems. The combination of {SPECT} and {CT} evolved from early transmission techniques used for attenuation correction with the initial commercial systems predating the release of {PET}/{CT}. The development and acceptance of {SPECT}/{CT} has been relatively slow with continuing debate as to what cost/performance ratio is justified. Increasingly, fully diagnostic {CT} is combined with {SPECT} so as to facilitate optimal clinical utility.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

The goal of {OMEGA} is to allow easy and fast reconstruction of any {PET} data, and to provide a computationally efficient, easy-access platform for development of new {PET} algorithms with built-in forward and backward projection operations available to the user as a {MATLAB}/Octave class. {OMEGA} also includes direct support for {GATE} simulated data, facilitating easy evaluation of the new algorithms using Monte Carlo simulated {PET} data. {OMEGA} supports parallel computing by utilizing {OpenMP} for {CPU} implementations and {OpenCL} for {GPU} allowing any hardware to be used. {OMEGA} includes built-in function for the computation of normalization correction and allows several other corrections to be applied such as attenuation, randoms or scatter. {OMEGA} includes several different maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) algorithms with several different priors. The user can also input their own priors to the built-in {MAP} functions. The image reconstruction in {OMEGA} can be computed either by using an explicitly computed system matrix or with a matrix-free formalism, where the latter can be accelerated with {OpenCL}. We provide an overview on the software and present some examples utilizing the different features of the software.},

Traditional parallel-hole and fan-beam collimators used in clinical practice, for example, have a relatively poor sensitivity and subcentimeter spatial resolution, while in small-animal imaging, pinhole collimators are used to obtain submillimeter resolution and multiple pinholes are often combined to increase sensitivity. This paper reviews methods for production, sensitivity maximization, and task-based optimization of collimation for both clinical and preclinical imaging applications. New opportunities for improved collimation are now arising primarily because of (i) new collimator-production techniques and (ii) detectors with improved intrinsic spatial resolution that have recently become available. These new technologies are expected to impact the design of collimators in the future. The authors also discuss concepts like septal penetration, high-resolution applications, multiplexing, sampling completeness, and adaptive systems, and the authors conclude with an example of an optimization study for a parallel-hole, fan-beam, cone-beam, and multiple-pinhole collimator for different applications.},

Depending on the targeted processes within the living organism, different tracers are used for various medical conditions, such as cancer, particular brain pathologies, cardiac events, and bone lesions, where the most commonly used tracers are radiolabeled with 18F (e.g., [18F]-{FDG} and {NA} [18F]). Oxygen-15 isotope is mostly involved in blood flow measurements, whereas a wide array of 11C-based compounds have also been developed for neuronal disorders according to the affected neuroreceptors, prostate cancer, and lung carcinomas. In contrast, the single-photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) technique uses gamma-emitting radioisotopes and can be used to diagnose strokes, seizures, bone illnesses, and infections by gauging the blood flow and radio distribution within tissues and organs. The radioisotopes typically used in {SPECT} imaging are iodine-123, technetium-99m, xenon-133, thallium-201, and indium-111. This systematic review article aims to clarify and disseminate the available scientific literature focused on {PET}/{SPECT} radiotracers and to provide an overview of the conducted research within the past decade, with an additional focus on the novel radiopharmaceuticals developed for medical imaging.},
