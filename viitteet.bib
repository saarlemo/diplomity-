	abstract = {In this paper we present {OMEGA}, an open-source software, for efficient and fast image reconstruction in positron emission tomography ({PET}). {OMEGA} uses the scripting language of {MATLAB} and {GNU} Octave allowing reconstruction of {PET} data with a {MATLAB} or {GNU} Octave interface. The goal of {OMEGA} is to allow easy and fast reconstruction of any {PET} data, and to provide a computationally efficient, easy-access platform for development of new {PET} algorithms with built-in forward and backward projection operations available to the user as a {MATLAB}/Octave class. {OMEGA} also includes direct support for {GATE} simulated data, facilitating easy evaluation of the new algorithms using Monte Carlo simulated {PET} data. {OMEGA} supports parallel computing by utilizing {OpenMP} for {CPU} implementations and {OpenCL} for {GPU} allowing any hardware to be used. {OMEGA} includes built-in function for the computation of normalization correction and allows several other corrections to be applied such as attenuation, randoms or scatter. {OMEGA} includes several different maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) algorithms with several different priors. The user can also input their own priors to the built-in {MAP} functions. The image reconstruction in {OMEGA} can be computed either by using an explicitly computed system matrix or with a matrix-free formalism, where the latter can be accelerated with {OpenCL}. We provide an overview on the software and present some examples utilizing the different features of the software.},

Single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) has a long history of development since its initial demonstration by Kuhl and Edwards in 1963. Although clinical utility has been dominated by the rotating gamma camera, there have been many technological innovations with the recent popularity of organ-specific dedicated {SPECT} systems. The combination of {SPECT} and {CT} evolved from early transmission techniques used for attenuation correction with the initial commercial systems predating the release of {PET}/{CT}. The development and acceptance of {SPECT}/{CT} has been relatively slow with continuing debate as to what cost/performance ratio is justified. Increasingly, fully diagnostic {CT} is combined with {SPECT} so as to facilitate optimal clinical utility.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

This review will introduce single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomographic imaging of the brain, including the history of their development, technical considerations, and a brief overview of pertinent radiopharmaceuticals and their applications.},
